## Goals

Our goal is to create an easy to use store front in which users would be able to browse and shop the current line of clothing that Renegade will be releasing. Their plan is to start small and expand their site if needed. With this in mind we would like to create their back end database with growth in mind. Creating an Admin portal where select users would be able to update the site as needed, so this will have to be built with simplicity in mind as we want this to be user friendly.

## Solution

We will create an easy-to-use front end for users to shop on while providing an intuitive back end that allows for continuous updates as needed.

## Project Outline

We will use the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap client-side templating.
- Mongo DB (Mongoose) Data Model.
- MERN Stack.
- Hosted on Heroku (may need to update).
- Domain name purchased through GoDaddy.
- Stripe for payment processing and client side inventory management.
- Passport/JWT (passportjwt packet)
